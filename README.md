# Russian-Speaking-Bot
I got the idea for this thinking about how myself and other Russian speakers/learners can practice our speaking skills. So I checked to see if ChatGPT understands Russian, then decided to use it with some kind of text-to-speech and vice-verse functionality. Thus Yuri was birthed. Like Athena emerging from Zeus' forehead. The Future is now. Russian students can practice their speaking with robots. No excuses!!!
